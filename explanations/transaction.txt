This transaction demonstrates how to interact with two NFT collections stored in an account's storage and perform operations on them. It begins by borrowing a reference to the NonFungibleToken.Collection resource located at /storage/myNFTCollection. If the collection cannot be found at this path, the transaction halts with an error. Once the reference is successfully retrieved, the transaction retrieves the list of NFT IDs in the collection using the getIDs method and logs the total count of NFTs.

Next, the transaction attempts to borrow another reference to a NonFungibleToken.Collection resource stored at /storage/anotherNFTCollection. Similar to the first collection, an error is thrown if this second collection cannot be found. Upon successfully borrowing the reference, the transaction retrieves and logs the number of NFTs in this second collection.
