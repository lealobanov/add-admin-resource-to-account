This transaction is designed to add an Admin resource to an account, granting the account administrative privileges within the ExampleNFT contract. It first checks if the Admin resource already exists in the account's storage to avoid creating duplicate resources. 

If the Admin resource does not exist, the transaction calls the createAdmin function from the ExampleNFT contract to create a new Admin resource. This resource is then moved into the accountâ€™s storage at the specified path /storage/nftAdminResource.
